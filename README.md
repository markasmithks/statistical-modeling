# Statistical Modeling

This repository contains structured demonstrations of foundational statistical models.

Each numbered directory represents a self-contained modeling study, including:

- Mathematical formulation
- Simulation or estimation code
- Visualization
- Reproducible structure

The purpose of this repository is to reinforce statistical foundations through implementation and experimentation.
